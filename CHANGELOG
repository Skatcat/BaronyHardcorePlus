SEPTEMBER 2024 UPDATE

- race balance changes
-- damage tables adjusted
--- unarmed is now only weak vs trolls, slimes, shadows, mimics and automatons; it's also quite strong vs the bosses now
# unarmed is an underwhelming weapon type in general, this change is to make it only uneffective in the most intuitive cases.
--- goblins are now slightly resistant to all melee
# as a melee-focused race, it makes sense for goblins to be a bit tougher at close-range
--- goatmen are now resistant to all melee except polearms; less susceptible to magic by 10 %
# same reasoning as goblin - here the damage tables didn't reflect the goatman's specialization properly, also they took the most exta damage from magic (70 %) with little to outweigh it.
--- automatons now have 50 % ranged resistance
# intuitive buff for a race that otherwise has only weaknesses as far as damage goes.
--- vampires are now weaker against melee
# small intuitive nerf to vampires
--- succubi are now weaker against melee
# see vampire

- class balance changes
-- Barbarian and Ninja stat growth swapped
# doesn't it make more sense for the Barbarian to be the class with CON growth? and less CHR? seems like both a balance and intuition adjustment
-- Arcanist: spawns with new Arcane Arrows, which apply Arcane Mark
# to give the Arcanist added support capabilities and aid him in early game where ranged resistances are abundant
-- Barbarian: spawns with new Ring of Rage item and Potion of Strength
--- Ring of Rage: buffs strength potion effects, giving more STR, giving CON and lifesteal on enemy kills. downside: you lose HP while under a strength potion's effect and health potions are weakened
# a fun rework that fits with the classic Barbarian archetype
-- Brewer: starts with healing, paralysis and strength potions. Spawns with additional empty bottles. Spawns with 10 fewer Alchemy skill points, gains Hazard Goggles
# the Brewer is supposed to get creative with having access to many potions early on, but access to really good potions is luck based. this should give him a bit of early game consistency. Also, the addition of goggles will make him good against firestorm gnomes. More empty bottles = more opportunities to get early water
-- Conjurer: conjured skeletons get 1.6x EXP; life-saving amulet removed
# the Conjurer never scaled properly in HC+, this should make him viable again
-- Merchant: starts with a Purple Artifact Orb
# this gives the Merchant access to some secret parts of the game - his new class gimmick
-- Rogue: starts with 30 sword and 30 ranged as opposed to 25
# slight buff to his stats
-- Rogue: now has bear traps and daggers
# items moved from Ninja to Rogue
-- Ninja: starts with 20 ranged as opposed to 40
# the Ranged skill of the Ninja probably reflects his proficiency with throwing weapons. Imo 40 is too big of a boost for a damage type that is quite crazy due to its later legendary bonuses. In the end, the Ninja should be more incentivized to be a melee build - this is also a shadow buff to the Rogue
-- Ninja: PER and CON growth swapped, spawns with 2 PER instead of 1
# why does the fragile assassin level CON? Give him PER to make use of the new sniper bonus
-- Ninja: no bear trap and daggers, has 1 crystal shuriken and potions of confusion now.
# fits his glass cannon DPS archetype more

- map and monster changes
-- mine to swamp miniboss harder, caves to citadel miniboss harder
# I found The Jibster and Deekin to be a bit underwhelming
-- you can't reach the Minetown miniboss anymore by digging through the exit room
# was a bit too simple for my taste
-- Minetown always spawns
# not getting minetown is just too big a disadvantage in its current state, it messes with the entire run imo
-- swamp to labyrinth miniboss drops potions of strength
# just to add another opportunity to get some strength potions
-- increased power of Mystic Library humans
# to make them not cannon fodder
-- stealth hunters (invisible levitating skeletons with hunting arrows) and blinders (inviisble skeletons throwing blindness potions) added to the Underworld
# I wanted the Underworld to be even more messed up
-- certain monsters will now relentlessly chase players (imps in Haunted Castle, vampire assassins and The Jubster; also floor 41 of Hell)
# when fitting, I decided to make monsters actively engage the player on the entire map
-- in SkyTown, killing guards or the mayor will now spawn SkyTown Deathbringers who will hunt players relentlessly
# to incentivize a more stealthy or peaceful approach to the first segment
-- Vampire Assassins spawn in invaded Hamlet
# to add some challenge
-- Baphomet now fires poison and bleed projectiles alongside fireballs
# Bapho's projectiles were kind of weak compared to everything else that's going on in the fight so now he basically spawns 3 projectiles at once, all inside each other
-- lava boulders in the Baphomet fight deal much higher damage now
# just to give you another reason to cry
-- Erudyce's missile barrage is faster; Clones of Orpheus now appear when you kill Erudyce first; curses will annoy you during the fight
# To spice the fight up
-- You can now always find a Spellbook of Teleportation on the Underworld start island
# Due to there being more monsters, it seems to occur at times, that the shrines can't teleport you due to the destination being blocked my monsters. If they don't/can't move away, you are kinda softlocked. Giving players the opportunity to learn teleport (if they haven't yet) alleviates this.

- item changes
-- adjusted spawn level of life saving amulets
# life saving artifacts were too plentiful in my opinion
-- buffed the artifact weapons
--- Gungnir and Parashu effect chance to scales from 0 - 100 % like Dyrnwyn
--- Gungnir AC pierce increases at 60 polearm skill (70 % pierce) and at 100 polearm skill (90 % pierce)
--- Sharur now returns your MP for every spell costing less than 10 mana and returns half your MP for all other spells
--- Sharur lets you snap out of sleep and fear (because his voice is so grating)
# the artifact weapons were not a satisfying in HC+ before, now their abilities should feel more useful
-- potions of strength increase throwing weapon velocity
# just for fun

- spell changes
-- strike spell buffed, bonus damage dependent on unarmed skill
# this spell is not worth standing in place for 2 seconds, maybe like this it'll have its niches

- miscellaneous changes
-- enemy INT now affects their spell power - adding INT/2 to damage
# basically this means magic monsters can now be QUITE strong
-- the ranged armor pierce chance dependent on perception now goes up to 100 %
# PER is bad enough anyway, give it a buff
-- added a sniper bonus to ranged and thrown weapons, based on PER and range (excluding bosses)
-- chakrams and shuriken have an increased sniping bonus
-- daggers and tomahawks can, starting with 60 stealth, inflict root upon backstabs
-- boomerang will always root at a certain distance, root duration scales with distance
-- boomerang return speed scales with range (caps at 3 seconds, like vanilla)
# this adds yet another use to PER which rewards positioning
-- added CHR based fear - if your CHR is high enough, charged hits inflict fear. Whether it works and duration is based on your CHR and their stats. Backstabs always give duration bonus.
-- it also works on ranged, in this case, however it's an Arbalest only bonus. Whether it works or not is also based on ranged skill here.
-- added regeneration to followers based on CHR and leadership. Notes: The buff only applies to monsters that aren't much stronger than yourself and only if you have more than 1/4 of your HP.
# CHR is also an underwhelming stat, with this perhaps it'll have more value
-- attacking during dash now gives you a damage bonus
-- unlocked at 60 stealth, hitting a charged backstab during dash inflicts extra damage, root and slow
# thought it'd be fun
-- maximum attainable MP regen increased
# because it's fun to stack MP regen
-- golems and cockatrices are protected from Domination starting with the Citadel
# if you manage to dominate many of these guys, it's basically GG. this change should make it less of a cheesy strat and make the Caves an important place for you to collect golems and cockatrices if you want to do that.
-- Hell is now redesigned, adding a large version and a wave based arena!
# to make it a bit more interesting
-- taking too long at the Baron Herx fight will now not spawn monsters but send you 20 floors ahead, straight into Hell
# this should equal death but IF you beat the game like this, consider yourself a GOD

- fixes and QoL
-- hell was redesigned due to performance issues
-- added a warning when Levitation is running out
-- fixed a bug where a multiplayer client's appraisal would be set to 0 due to faulty map scripts
-- crashes and inventory saving issue in SkyTown fixed
-- fixed the SkyTown gates not being interactable with Interact Aim Assist disabled
-- fixed the Reflect Magic spell crashing the game
-- removed enemies wielding the fear spell since it caused crashes in combination with reflecting
-- added an alternative version of Ozyx' Domain without voice acting. simply rename the file called "fskincustom_novoice" to "fskincustom" and backup the original if you want to switch back.

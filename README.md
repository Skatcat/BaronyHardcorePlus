# BARONY HARDCORE+

This is the source for fskin's Barony HC+ mod. Basically every relevant change has annotations saying "fskin note:".

Download from Steam Workshop for the actual mod (soon).

If you're a tester and got the files from Discord, here's what you want to do:
- Backup your Barony folder steamapps/common/Barony (or at least your savegames and scores)
- If you're not using a fresh install, delete your models.cache and both scores files.
- Put all the files from the .zip into your Barony main folder
- Play! Remember to enable hardcore mode in the game flags. The mod is balanced around hardcore mode. It's not obligatory, though.
